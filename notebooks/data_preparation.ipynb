ZOOKEEPER-2630: Use interface type instead of implementation type whe…\\n\\nUse interface type instead of implementation type when appropriate.\\n\\nThere are a couple of places in code base where we declare a field / variable as implementation type (i.e. HashMap, HashSet) instead of interface type (i.e. Map, Set), while in other places we do the opposite by declaring as interface type. A quick check indicates that most if not all of these places could be updated so we have a consistent style over the code base (prefer using interface type), which is also a good coding style to stick per best practice.\\n\\nChecked and fixed Set, Map and List interface usages.\\n\\nAuthor: Tamas Penzes <tamaas@cloudera.com>\\n\\nReviewers: Abe Fine <afine@apache.org>, Michael Han <hanm@apache.org>\\n\\nCloses #354 from tamaashu/ZOOKEEPER-2630.
